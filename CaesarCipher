Caesar Cipher is the earliest and the simplest use of a substitution cipher. It was employed by Julius Caesar hence the name "Caesar Cipher".
Historically, Caesar Cipher replaces letters in the plaintext with letters three places down the alphabet, circulating the end of the alphabet back to the beginning. For example:

CAESAR becomes FDHVDU

Caesar Cipher encrypts letters one at a time using one technique. Therefore, it is called a monoalphabetic simple substitution cipher. Monoalphabetic means that it applies one rule for all the plaintext, and simple substitution means that it substitute letters one by one. If English alphabets are encoded to integers ranging from 0 to 25 based on alphabetical order, the generic form of Caesar Cipher is:

C = E(p) = (p + k) mod(26) where k = a value in the range [1,25]

p = D(C) = (C - k) mod(26) where k = a value in the range [1,25]

C = the ciphered letter
E = the Caesar Cipher encryption function
p = the plaintext letter
k = the shift count, between 1 to 25
mod(26) = the remainder, dividing (p+k) or (C-k) by 26
D =the Casear Cipher decryption funtion

Caesar cipher is not a secure cipher. Since:

The encryption algorithm is easily known
There are only 25 possible key
The plaintext is in a known and easily recognizable language
Cryptoanalysis possible by analyzing letter frequencies
A brute-force attack can be performed quickly by trying out all 25 possible keys. For example:
